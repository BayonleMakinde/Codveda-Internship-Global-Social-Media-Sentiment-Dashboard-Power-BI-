# Codveda-Internship-Global-Social-Media-Sentiment-Dashboard-Power-BI-

## 📌 Project Overview
As a **Data Analysis Intern** at **Codveda Technologies**, I designed and developed an interactive dashboard to analyze social media sentiment across multiple platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook). The goal was to provide a 360-degree view of user engagement and emotional trends on a global scale.

## 🛠️ Data Engineering (The Cleaning Process)
Raw social media data is notoriously unstructured. I performed the following **ETL** steps in **Power Query**:
* **Text Normalization**: Trimmed white spaces and standardized country names for accurate geographic mapping.
* **Sentiment Categorization**: Grouped over 100+ nuanced emotional labels into high-level categories (**Positive, Negative, Neutral**) using conditional logic.
* **Date Hierarchy**: Engineered a calendar table from raw timestamps to enable Year-Month-Day drill-down capabilities.

## 📊 Key Dashboard Insights
1. **Engagement Drivers**: Identified which platforms (e.g., Instagram vs. Twitter) generate the highest "Likes per Post" ratio.
2. **Global Reach**: Mapped user activity across 15+ countries to identify regional sentiment hotspots.
3. **Sentiment Trends**: Tracked the correlation between specific events (Hashtags) and peaks in engagement.

## 🚀 Interactive Features
* **Platform Slicer**: Allows users to filter the entire report by specific social networks.
* **Time-Series Slider**: Enables a deep dive into specific historical periods.
* **Cross-Filtering**: Clicking on a specific country on the map automatically updates the Sentiment and Engagement charts for that region.
